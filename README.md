ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Angelina!  
ðŸŽ“ Computer Science major + Math minor @ Rutgers University  
ðŸš€ AI Intern @ SHI | Break Through Tech AI Fellow | Incoming Undergraduate Researcher

I'm passionate about making AI systems more **scalable**, **responsible**, and **human-centered**. Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into large language models, infrastructure, and retrieval-augmented generation. But what really excites me is the **intersection of AI and robotics**â€”how intelligent systems perceive, learn, and interact with the physical world.

Next year, Iâ€™ll be joining a **research program** at Rutgers focused on applying AI in robotics, and I canâ€™t wait to explore how we can bridge perception, reasoning, and real-world action.
